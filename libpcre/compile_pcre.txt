The libpcre.a was compiled this way:

- get the lastet MinGW distribution (mingw-get-inst-20120426.exe) at this time,
  providing gcc v.4.7.2

- ./configure --enable-newline-is-crlf --enable-utf --enable-unicode-properties --enable-jit --enable-shared=no --enable-static

- make

- the resulting .libs/*.a were copied into the libpcre directory

- the libgcc.a comes from the MinGW\lib\gcc\mingw32\4.7.2\ directory
