
DOCUMENTATION
=============

This is the documentation for uo_regex (pbni C++ extension) and unvo_regexp
(plain pbscript version).

Preamble
========

The unvo_regexp userobject was first written to map the vbscript.regex OLE
object into a object useable in PB10. The possibilities (and limitations ;)
are those offered by the vbscript object. No less, no more.

The uo_regex (C++ PBNI extension) was later written as an attempt to get the
same functionnalities in a compiled extension without the bottleneck of
repetitive OLE objects instanciations. As the unvo_regexp was already
heavily used in a project and the uo_regex was planned as a replacement for
it, the uo_regex mimics by design the unvo_regexp.


Quick start
===========

unvo_regexp regex
regex = create unvo_regexp
regex.initialize('[0-9]+', true, true)
if regex.test('foobar 42') then messagebox('test','match!')
or 
if regex.search('foobar 42') then messagebox('search','match : ' + regex.match(1))
destroy unvo_regexp


List of the available methods & properties for unvo_regexp (powerscript + vbscrip.regex)
==========================================================

Properties
----------

boolean globalScope : tells if the regex search and/or replaces in global mode or not 
		      (default = true)

boolean ignoreCase : tells if the matching is case sensitive or not 
		     (default = true = case INsensitive)

string searchPattern : stores the regexp pattern

Methods
-------

initialize (string as_pattern, boolean ab_globalscope, boolean ab_casesensitive) 

   Sets the global, ignoreCase & pattern attributes of the ole regex. 
   You MUST call initialize() to compile the search pattern before actual search.

initialize()
   Same as the previous initialize, reuses the instance variables as arguments

test ( string as_teststring ) 
   Tells only if the given string matches the regexp.

search ( string as_searchstring )
   Look for the previously compiled regexp into the given search string. The
   right name for this method should be 'execute' but it is a reserved name
   in powerscripts ;)
   Returns : the number of matches, or -1
   Remark : if you don't search in global mode, there can be only 0 or 1 match.

matchCount ( )  
   Returns the number of matches in the previous search() 
   PbniRegex has for the moment a hardcoded limitation of 300 matches.

match ( long al_index )  
   Returns the content of the given match. The first match has index 1.

matchPosition ( long al_index )
   Returns the offset of the given match or -1 if al_index is wrong.

matchLength ( long al_index )
   Returns the length of the given match or -1 if al_index is wrong.

replace ( string as_searchstring, string as_replacestring )
   Returns the result of the replacement of the pattern by the
   as_replacestring into the as_searchstring. If no match occurs, the
   original string is returned.

groupcount ( long al_matchindex )  
   When using the pattern grouping, returns the number of groups in the
   given match.
   PbniRegex for the moment has a hardcoded limitation to 20 groups per match.

group ( long al_matchindex, long al_groupindex )
  When using the pattern grouping, returns the content of the given group of
  the given match.


List of the available methods for uo_regex (C++ wrapper for PCRE)
==========================================

pcreversion()
   Returns the version of PCRE wrapped in the pbx

The following methods and functions give the same results than with the unvo_regexp :
initialize() - see th eremark below about error codes
test ( string as_teststring ) 
search ( string as_searchstring )
matchCount ( )  
match ( long al_index )  
matchPosition ( long al_index )
matchLength ( long al_index )
groupcount ( long al_matchindex )  
group ( long al_matchindex, long al_groupindex )
  remark: the whole match will be in group #0 to mimick the vbscript behavior

Initialize() errors
-------------------
If the compiling of the regexp fails, an error message is outputted via the
OutputDebugString API and can be seen e.g. with SysInternal DebugView tool
or MS Visual Studio.

Replace
-------
replace ( string as_searchstring, string as_replacestring )

The PCRE engine can only search and does not provides replacing
functionality, therefore I have implemented my own replace method. 
While the replace func has the same prototype than the vbscript one, it has
been extended and has the possiblity to uses the perl-like backslash-number
notation (\1, \2 .. \n) to reuse for replacement the matched groups.

Note : for the moment the expansion of the groups is limited to the first 9
ones. It must be extended to be a little more perlish.



The following functions are in addition to the unvo_regexp ones :

groupposition(long al_matchindex, long al_groupindex)
   Returns the offset of the given group of the given match.

grouplength(long al_matchindex, long al_groupindex)
   Returns the length of the given group of the given match.

setmultiline(boolean ismulti)
   Sets the possibilty to match the EOL character with '.'

ismultiline()
   Returns the state of the multiline setting.

setutf8(boolean isutf)
   Sets the possibilty to use utf-8 strings for pattern & search strings

isutf8()
   Returns the state of the utf-8 processing.

study()
   Proceed to a study of the regexp in ordrer to speed up (if possible)
   repetitive use of it.

   From the PCRE documentation :
   « At present, studying a pattern is useful only for non-anchored patterns
   that do not have a single fixed starting character. A bitmap of possible
   starting bytes is created. »

Global functions
----------------

In order to replace some powerscript written functions by native code, the
PbniRegex.pbx also provides the followin global functions :

fastreplaceall(string as_source, string as_pattern, string as_replace)
   Returns the resulting string of the replacement of as_pattern by
   as_replace into as_source. If the as_pattern is not found, returns the
   as_source input string.
   Remark : the serach is ALWAYS case sensitive.

fastreplaceall2(string as_source, string as_pattern, string as_replace, boolean ab_casesensitive)
   Same as fastreplaceall but with the possibility to specify if the search is case-sensitive or not.
