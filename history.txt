HISTORY
=======

2009-03-16 - Minor refactor of the GUI + added a mini-help
             TODO : there is a little GUI problem : the close button and system menu have disappeared
                    you have to quit with the File / Quit menu item

2009-03-12 - Nicolas Georges added the unit-test functionnality, and introduced several GUI improvements :
             auto-resizing + horizontal and vertical splitters (only the vertical is used by now)

2009-03-11 - Bugfix in Replace() : broken by last modification to get the capturing groups count, 
             was replacing only the first occurence
             Bugfix 2 : trying to replace an empty string by an empty string got endless loop :S
             Nicolas Georges refactored the UI to use a splitter and and added a live-update of the results

2009-02-25 - Bugfix in Replace() : use the number of capturing groups from the pattern 
             instead of the number of the matched groups for the expansion of the \nn items.
             E.g: Replace() returned \1 instead of an empty string when a pattern with a capturing group
             matched nothing.

2009-02-09 - fixaround with search() when a match has null length
             I noticed that the HeapAlloc calls *should* be surrounded by try/catch ;)

2008-11-26 - added the getpattern() method

2008-11-14 - fixed the correct handling of the option multiline
             added the options and methods to handle dot-match-newlines, ungreedy and extended syntax
             minor layout changes in regex coach

2008-11-13 - bugfix : crashing during replace() when a group matches nothing is bad :o)

2008-11-11 - rewrote the vector allocation for matches & groups with dynamic allocation
             added the study method

2008-11-05 - first public release

2008-09-08 - creation of PbRegexCoach as a test tool for PbniRegex
