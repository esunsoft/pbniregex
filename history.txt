=======

2009-04-27 - PBX recompiled with PB 10.5.2.7826

2009-04-01 - I noticed that the utf-8 mode was buggy : when strings contained some
             extended chars, both length & positions functions returned wrong values and
             the returned strings were not correctly translated back into PB internal
             utf-16. Reworked the internal string handling to always work in utf-8,
             setutf8() does nothing and isutf8() always returns true.

             The initialize() method does not fail anymore if the pattern is null (it used
             to return a PBX_E_INVOKE_WRONG_NUM_ARGS status in that case)

             I reworked the UI layout a bit with Nicolas Georges. The close menu problem
             is solved.

             The license conditions were updated to adopt the formal MIT license.

2009-03-16 - Minor refactor of the GUI + added a mini-help TODO : there is a little GUI
             problem : the close button and system menu have disappeared you have to quit
             with the File / Quit menu item

2009-03-11 - Bugfix in Replace() : broken by last modification to get the capturing groups
             count, was replacing only the first occurence

             Bugfix 2 : trying to replace an empty string by an empty string got endless
             loop :S 

             Nicolas Georges refactored the UI to use a splitter and added a live-update
             of the results. There is also a unit-test functionnality now.

2009-02-25 - Bugfix in Replace() : use the number of capturing groups from the pattern
             instead of the number of the matched groups for the expansion of the \nn
             items. E.g: Replace() returned \1 instead of an empty string when a pattern
             with a capturing group matched nothing.

2009-02-09 - fixaround with search() when a match has null length
             I noticed that the HeapAlloc calls *should* be surrounded by try/catch ;)

2008-11-26 - added the getpattern() method

2008-11-14 - fixed the correct handling of the option multiline 

             added the options and methods to handle dot-match-newlines, ungreedy and
             extended syntax minor layout changes in regex coach

2008-11-13 - bugfix : crashing during replace() when a group matches nothing is bad :o)

2008-11-11 - rewrote the vector allocation for matches & groups with dynamic allocation
             added the study() method

2008-11-05 - first public release

2008-09-08 - creation of PbRegexCoach as a test tool for PbniRegex

2008-09-01 - start of the project
