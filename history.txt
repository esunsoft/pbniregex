HISTORY
=======

2009-03-11 - Bugfix in Replace() : broken by last modification to get the capturing groups count, 
             was replacing only the first occurence :S

2009-02-25 - Bugfix in Replace() : use the number of capturing groups from the pattern 
             instead of the number of the matched groups for the expansion of the \nn items.
             E.g: Replace() returned \1 instead of an empty string when a pattern with a capturing group
             matched nothing.

2009-02-09 - fixaround with search() when a match has null length
             I noticed that the HeapAlloc calls *should* be surrounded by try/catch ;)

2008-11-14 - fixed the correct handling of the option multiline
